Net Salary Calculator

This JavaScript program calculates the net salary for Kenyan employees based on their basic salary and benefits. It accounts for the following deductions:

    PAYE: Progressive tax rates based on gross income.
    NHIF: Health insurance deductions as per the official scale.
    NSSF: Social security contributions, with capped limits.

The program takes user input for basic salary and benefits, calculates the gross salary, deducts PAYE, NHIF, and NSSF, and outputs the net salary.

Run the code in a browser-based environment like PlayCode.
