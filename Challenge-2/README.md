Speed Detector 

This program is designed to check a car's speed and determine if the driver gets a ticket (demerit points) or if their license gets suspended based on how fast they were driving. 
How It Works

    1.User Input:
        The program will ask the user (you) to enter the car's speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) using a prompt box.

    2.Logic Behind the Speed Check:
        If the speed is less than 70 km/h, the program will just say "Ok" â€” everything is fine.
        If the speed is 70 km/h or more, it will calculate how many demerit points the driver gets.
            For every 5 km/h over the speed limit (70 km/h), 1 demerit point is given.
            If the driver gets more than 12 demerit points, their license will be suspended.
            If they get 12 or fewer points, it will show how many points they have.

    3. Output:
        The result will be displayed in the console, so you'll need to open the browser's developer tools to see it.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

This program is designed to run in PlayCode.io, a browser-based JavaScript playground, and not in Node.js. Follow these steps to run it:

    1.Open your browser and go to PlayCode.io.
    2.Copy and paste the code into the editor on the left-hand side.
    3.Click the "Run" button to execute the program.
    4.Enter the car's speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) in the prompt box that appears, then press "OK."
    5.View the result in the console on the right-hand side.
